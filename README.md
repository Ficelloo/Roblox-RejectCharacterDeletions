Hey! this is all of my work during march-april making this "bypass" more like a work around ngl

take the Dummy.lua as an example to make ur own reanimation script

If you are planning to use it, please don't remove credits. Be nice

Small update: I know right this code isn't the best, that's was the first rushed bypass i've made but still this is working! I hope y'all will make a lot of good script using my bypass
